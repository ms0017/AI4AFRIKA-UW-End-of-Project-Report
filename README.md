## **Sir Frimpong’s Computer**

I am a people person: perhaps because my house had almost 50 people living in it at any given point in time. I am also a technology person: perhaps because of the appeal it created as it remained mostly inaccessible to me growing up. Some of my favorite childhood memories revolve around the single computer owned by my elementary school teacher, ‘Sir Frimpong.’ My school had no computers so instead of reading about “Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing” in our ICT textbooks and our teachers having to draw “Microsoft Word” on the board every time, my classmates and I decided to walk for miles to carry the entire set from Sir Frimpong’s house to the school and back after the end of the day. We did this for my entire duration in elementary school for all the days we had an ICT class. His set consisted of a voluminous system unit, a gigantic cathode ray tube monitor,  two mice (the computer had a pair of mice plugged in simultaneously because each one would stop at random times and you had to resort to the other), and other accessories needed to operate the aged, perhaps Pentium 2 computer.

My interest in technologies only escalated after elementary school though. In high school, I would steal old and dusty programming books from the library; that is, if you think Visual Basic is programming. No one ever noticed those books were gone, and I honestly think they still do not. I blame this disinterestedness on the unavailability and inaccessibility of computers and other technologies in my school. What good were those books anyway? Who was going to read a programming book without a computer? Would you just imagine what the ‘If’ and ‘Else’ conditions did when executed? Of course, that is exactly what I did. 

Truthfully, I do not remember what I learned about Visual Basic because I never had the liberty to practice what I read in the books. I simply enjoyed gazing at the texts and exploring what could be done with programming. I enjoyed the different colored code segments. The indentation of the lines. The sense of potential that those pages radiated when they stared at me.

After high school, my greatest pal lent me his laptop for a few months. The screws and glue on the frame of this computer were feverishly clinging on to dear life. Improper handling and you would be greeted with the computer’s internals. The screen only functioned when positioned at a specific angle or when slapped with a certain pressure. Regardless, to me, that computer was the best thing ever.

Hardware-ish: check. 

Internet: expensive as fuck.

However, there was a university close by. This was fortunate because all I had to do was walk 7 miles to and another 7 miles back every day to connect to the internet. I would download Youtube videos on the only programming language in my world: Visual Basic. Gosh, it would take forever to download a single video, but it was always worth it.

Just like with the books, I did not watch those long Youtube videos to ‘learn programming’ or anything in particular. I just did it because I enjoyed watching them. Those videos awakened a huge passion in me. They somehow gave me a sense of freedom in constructing my ideal society: one in which humans and machines worked side-by-side to deconstruct and reconstruct societies. Remember these were my late teenage years when I was fully absorbing the magnitude of societal issues all around me and had just discovered the ‘Virus. Do not open!’ folder tucked away in a pipeline of other folders on my borrowed laptop.

## **Humans and Machines**

Very early on in my undergraduate career, I sought to merge my humanities interests with my computer science training.

After working with amazing people like Reginold Royston, Ph.D. in evaluating African transnational ties and technology in Africa, engaging with groups like AI4AFRIKA, “a cross-sectoral ‘think and action’ consortium dedicated to ensuring that African talent and perspectives play a central role in the development trajectory of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies”, and through independent research, it dawned on me that AI is not a fair playing ground and that those most affected by it are those least represented in its creation process.

Inspired by this premise, I created a student-led and student-run initiative called [`AI4AFRIKA@UW`](https://sheriffissaka.com/aiforafrica/); merging the identities of the two groups I aligned most with then and merging my humanities and computer science interests. My objective for this endeavor was to bring together undergraduates (especially those coming from minority groups), with the goal of creating responsible, equitable, and accessible AI technologies.


## **Enough Talking**

As you probably figured, this piece serves both as an end-of-project report and a personal reflection. The rest of this read will explore AI4AFRIKA@UW: the people, timelines, successes, institutions, lessons, and next steps.


## **Obroni**

‘Obroni’ is a Twi word that means ‘white person.’ 

During the Summer of 2020, my Chinese friend visited me in Ghana. It was a great experience. Well… except for the time we almost got arrested for visiting a border town without our passports and the fact that my friend spent half his trip in the toilet, as he could not resist the good foods his digestive system was encountering for the first time.

The main downside to that trip was the language barrier. My friend did not speak Twi, Kusasi, Hausa, Busanga, Dagomba, or Moosi (all the languages my mum speaks fluently.) While some people around me spoke English, none of them spoke Mandarin . People would fruitelessly try to start conversations with him by asking  “Obroni, 3tis3n?” meaning  “white person, how are you?” Yes, if you live in a society with little to no construct of race, if you are not black, you are obroni.

I had to be an interpreter for my friend and my people for the entire trip. I realized this was a tiresome task and inefficient since I had to be there, otherwise no communication would happen. Having taken a few computer science classes, I thought I could use my skills to build a tool that could allow communication without my presence. 

Hence, the first problem I decided to tackle with AI4AFRIKA@UW was the Machine Translation of Twi.

Halfway through my research and development of this project, I realized that a translation engine on its own would be great, but being able to really demonstrate its usefulness in a meaningful and relatable way would be even better. Hence, I decided to build a conversational chatbot that answers menstrual health questions in Twi. Why menstrual health? I have 14 sisters so why not?

Again, halfway through the chatbot’s development, I realized that building these tools on their own was good. But, since I was not building these tools just to boost my resume, I needed to make them easily accessible to people who needed them. Thus, the idea for a cross-platform mobile application that integrates these tools in an accessible manner came to be.


## **Teams**

Given the nature and the magnitude of the problems that AI4AFRIKA@UW sought to tackle (as described above), it was important to implement a team structure that allowed for seamless execution, a state we de facto call ‘being in the trenches.’

AI4AFRIKA@UW has had the privilege of working with amazing individuals, without whose contributions, insights, and hard work, none of this work would have been possible. I started team formations through my personal networks and other means like departmental relationships which grew with time. I am proud and grateful for the work done by each individual; most of whom did all this excellent work with little or no monetary compensation.

## **Institutional Support**

I cannot underestimate the significance of the generous financial support from these departments to AI4AFRIKA@UW. These institutions and their associated directors (Brian Yandell, Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, Aleia McCord, and Shivaram Venkataraman respectively) supported financially because they believed in my idea and vision. 

- **American Family Insurance Data Science Institute (AMFAMDSI)**

Having worked with the DSI for over a year, it was clear that their goals were aligned with AI4AFRIKA@UW’s. They generously provided the project with financial and computing resources. While I am grateful to all the individuals at AMFAMDSI, special thanks to Whitney Sweeney, Steve Goldstein, and Steven Wangen for their heartfelt support. These individuals have attended most if not all team meetings (at least once a week during the school year and every day over the summer). I cannot forget Brian Yandell for his leadership, interest, and support.

## **Community Partners**

- **CARE Ethiopia**

Besides interning  twice with CARE international, I was also able to collaborate with them in giving feedback and direction on our tools, primarily, our conversational chatbot.

- **Days for Girls (D4G)**

Through 4W, a UW Madison initiative that works with groups across the world, I was connected with D4G, a group in Ghana dedicated to delivering menstrual health products and information to rural areas. 

- **African Language Institute (ALI)**

Through the ASP, I was able to connect with ALI. The institute, based at the University of Texas, that shared its knowledge about the distribution and availability of African languages.


## **Milestones**

- **Before the Summer 0f 2021**

A lot of my focus was on understanding why anyone ate pickles and the landscape for experimenting and prototyping machine translation systems.

- **Summer of 2021**

I started receiving funding to facilitate the team’s expansion. This enabled the building of a stable translation engine alongside a framework for our mobile application.

For consistency reasons and in order to achieve desired results within a short period we met every day of the week for 10 weeks, with a better part of our time spent in the trenches of data collection and cleaning.

- **Fall 2022**

The team expanded again, especially on the frontend side. A lot of the effort was channeled towards finding a stable mobile application. Work also commenced on the chatbot--  with respect to data collection and technical exploration.

The team had weekly general meetings in addition to subteam meetings which were separate and held at the discretion of the subteam leads.

- **Spring 2022**

The team grew even further, this time on the data side. With this growth, we expanded our chatbot data size significantly. Other major advancements were made in the mobile application’s development. Field testing on the conversational chatbot also began.

Just like the previous semester, the team had weekly meetings as well as subteam meetings.


## **Major Technological Achievements**

- **Mobile app**

A stable mobile application that allows users to interact with our technologies.

- **Chatbot**

A high-performing chatbot that allows users to ask for and receive menstrual health-related information.

- **Machine translation**

A translation engine for Twi with a BLEU score of 0.47.


## **Next steps**

Again, my goal for this project was to bring together undergraduates (especially those coming from minority groups), to create responsible, equitable, and accessible AI technologies. While I am very proud of the work we have done together to progress toward this goal, this experience has taught me that creating responsible, equitable, and accessible AI will require a lifetime of effort and cannot be done alone. The principles of Ubuntu remind us that it is only through collective action that we can truly create a world that honors our shared humanity. I could not have done this without all of you encouraging me, challenging me, and yes, sometimes frustrating the hell out of me. Through my conversations with you, even the most difficult ones, I have been able to better understand my personal goals and appreciate just how much work remains for us to achieve this shared vision.

Like with most things, knowing when to start is just as important as knowing when to pass on the baton. I believe that attempting to continue my current role here as the project lead of AI4AFRIKA@UW would not result in the kind of outcomes that we all want to see from this initiative. As of May 14, 2022 (my undergraduate graduation date), I believe I can best serve our shared goals by focusing on my graduate work, and I hope that others will now step in to sustain the momentum of AI4AFRIKA@UW. Having started this initiative with the premise of “creating” technologies, I realized that the magnitude of the challenges surrounding technologies created by majorities for majorities requires the deconstruction and reconstruction of AI’s very foundations; with respect to architectural engineering, big data, knowledge embedding, base statistics, neural networks, computing infrastructure, heuristics methods, and algorithmic frameworks. Thus, the next phase of my career will be geared towards the scholarly understanding of these core elements of AI at a graduate school level.

My great hope is that AI4AFRIKA@UW vibrantly continues to evolve and creates a space for interested scholars and students to explore the dynamics and contributions of the humanities in pushing the boundaries of technologies, especially AI, to be more inclusive, equitable, and accessible. I will of course stay connected to this community, even if I am not able to take lead in the work as I have in the past. I believe that such an interdisciplinary effort is long overdue and requires the mental cycles of critical thinkers who ideate in an Ubuntu-centric manner.

All the useful information and documentation for this project can be ['found '](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S4WbbzIgyLi9SmGKnRQ0uU_FH_fJzCZe?usp=sharing)[`here`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S4WbbzIgyLi9SmGKnRQ0uU_FH_fJzCZe?usp=sharing) and can be used by anyone as they see fit with proper recognition. If you or your networks require any other information, please do not hesitate to contact me. This work celebrates the Ubuntu-centric model of technology development. It is open-source, and it belongs to all of us, and all of us have a responsibility to make it better. 

Coming from Sir Frimpong’s computer to this point in my career has been a long and exciting journey. This phase of this project and my career is not an end, but a new beginning. We do not know what lies ahead, but together, I know we can continue to make progress to create responsible, equitable and accessible AI. 


## **Special Appreciation**

That one person. There is always that one person in every journey who is always willing and ready to put service to the greater good above themselves. That one person who does not know what it means to give up and always says to themself “I am okay”. That one person who pushes you to the very limits to make you be the best version of yourself. That one person who you know you can absolutely count on and you know that most of what you have achieved would be close to impossible without them. That one person who has been there since the beginning and you know will be there till the end. That one person for me is my friend and colleague `Keyi Wang`.


## **Final Thoughts:**

I have spent the best part of my undergraduate career hacking away at this project. Given the number of times I have pulled my hair, I am honestly not surprised that my hairline is receding. Was it all worth it? Absolutely. Would I do it again? Heck yeah!

I truly appreciate all the challenges, lessons, skills, and especially the people I have encountered throughout this beautiful journey. I appreciate every member of the team for trusting my leadership. I am genuinely looking forward to seeing what the future holds for all of us.
